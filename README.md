# Discord to Discord Relay
## Link two discord channels with one another

## How does it work?
It uses the bot (not webhooks because they get rate limited easier) to transfer over messages with embeds. The embeds support embedded links, images and other bots embeds. The embeds contain the profile and name of the person with the sidebar being the color of the highest role that, that person has. 

Here is how it looks in action
